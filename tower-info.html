							<h1 class="major">Tower Rangers</h1>
							<p>Tower Rangers is a tower defense game built within Unreal Engine 5. Unlike other tower defense games, it distinguishes 
							itself by offering players direct control over their avatar within a dynamic 3D setting. The
							game contains multiple levels with different maps, each increasing in difficulty. Like other tower defense games, there is 
							an in-game currency system to purchase different towers with the objective of eliminating enemy NPCs before
							they reach the player's base.

							<h3>Skills and methods:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Unreal Engine 5: Provided a robust framework for developing and designing in a 3D game environment, as well as 
									facilitating the integration of high-resolution textures to deliver top-tier graphics.</li>
									<li>C++: The language used to write the blueprint of the game.</li>
									<li>Planning: Effective planning was paramount for advancing in our five-member project. We employed 
									various strategies, such as maintaining a product and sprint backlog, along with utilizing a burndown chart, to ensure deadlines were met consistently.</li>
